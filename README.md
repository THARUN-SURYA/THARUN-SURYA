# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tharun Surya!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student with a passion for **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of AI/ML through self-research and practical projects.

💼 I recently completed a **Virtual Internship** through [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/), gaining valuable exposure to real-world scenarios and professional workflows.

🌱 I'm continuously building my skills in:
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
- 📊 Machine Learning basics
- 💻 Python programming
- 🧠 Data structures and algorithms

🔍 I believe in learning by doing. I'm exploring projects and building a portfolio to showcase my progress.

🚀 I'm looking forward to contributing to open-source, collaborating with other learners, and becoming a better developer every day.
